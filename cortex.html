                As the title suggests, we are all one in the same fire, possessing the same universal pain and struggles, yet
                so absolutely in love with the universe. The only way to reconcile the immense pain we generate in this world with the 
                unbridled joy humans are capable of feeling is to fall madly in love with the universe and all it's existence
                has to offer. An unconditional love that does not waiver when ephemeral feelings of happiness fade, and one 
                that is never rooted in any egotistical attachment. 
                <br><br>
                You and I and he and her and we and them; we all exist as one in 
                the face of overwhelming suffering, and we can all rejoice for falling in love with this universe is the only solace we have.

            <h2>Happiness Imperatives</h2>
            <div class="meta">Neuron encoded at 18:52 on October 15, 2024 by Farmer</div>
            <p>
                <div>Joy is merely an ephemeral feeling brought about by the wonderful fruits of life, while happiness is a general state of mind
                in accordance with these three imperatives:
                </div>
            </p>
            <p>
                    1. The ability to fully live in the present, without being held back by the past or bound by the anxiety of an uncontrollable
                    future, fully enjoy every moment for what it is
                    <br><br>
                    2. Having a general contentness with how your life is without letting anybody or anything disturb your peace.
                    <br><br>
                    3. Having a general sense of complete freedom, the freedom to fully be who you truly are---your true unadulturated self, 
                    and the freedom to live how you want to live.
